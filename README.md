# BraceWP : A WordPress starter theme that uses a modern workflow

This is just my personal framework that implements a modern front-end workflow to create custom themes.

It uses:

- Sass as a CSS preprocessor. I use OOCSS with Suit CSS naming conventions to create modular architecture and components.
- Custom-coded Javascript
- Gulp as a task runner
- Timber as a WordPress templating engine
